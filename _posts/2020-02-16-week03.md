# Useful Skills for Contributing to Open Source
* My programming skills (general language knowledge)
* My computer science related skills (analytical thinking, algorithm knowledge, data structure knowledge)
* My writing composition capabilities (I can write a good essay, let alone documentation or a paragraph)
* My communication skills (granted I can get them to work better over the internet)


# My Interests
* Making music - song-writing, playing instruments, audio engineering.
* Listening to music .
* Birds - watching, drawing, feeding, fearing.
* Taking care of my plants - watering, feeding, pest control, etc.
* Learning new languages - currently studying Russian and maintaining my Italian.
* Comparing languages to one another - grammatically, cognates, cultural differences.
* Problem solving - sometimes doing coding interview practice gets me excited, not sure why; even more so for doing coding assignments (ask me about those!)
* Reading the news - more of a morbid curiosity these days. Always something interesting (or horrifying) going on.
* Reading wikipedia - history, present things, animals, franchises; its a past-time for me to spend hours reading about things on a whim there.
* Coin collecting - they look cool, foreign coins are a glimpse into foreign cultures too.
* Occasional fiction writing - I have many a draft but hardly a completed work. I have published one thing before but I'm not crazy about it (*dont* ask me about it).
* Occasional non-fictional writing - essays come easily to me, somehow; never really liked them (originally) but life seems to do that some times.
* Occasional consumption of new-weird fiction - the SCP Wiki is close to my heart for ten years despite never finishing a contribution. Additionally I just purchased Control which I hear is great so I'm looking forward to that
* Occasional returning to things I've consumed or played for years but take 8 month breaks (SCP Wiki (reading), Dwarf Fortress, Space Station 13, Runescape (games)); Something about these things draws me back to them. Perhaps their ever-evolving nature, or their communities.
* Helping others - I work in Retail now and sometimes enjoy being able to provide assistance to customers, I also try to help early computer science students when I can (just to pay it forward, or backwards, unsure).
