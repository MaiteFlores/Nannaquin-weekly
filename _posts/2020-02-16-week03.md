# Useful Skills for Contributing to Open Source
* My programming skills (general language knowledge)
* My computer science related skills (analytical thinking, algorithm knowledge, data structure knowledge)
* My writing composition capabilities (I can write a good essay, let alone documentation or a paragraph)
* My communication skills (granted I can get them to work better over the internet)


# My Interests
* Making music - song-writing, playing instruments, audio engineering.
* Listening to music .
* Birds - watching, drawing, feeding, fearing.
* Taking care of my plants - watering, feeding, pest control, etc.
* Learning new languages - currently studying Russian and maintaining my Italian.
* Comparing languages to one another - grammatically, cognates, cultural differences.
* Problem solving - sometimes doing coding interview practice gets me excited, not sure why; even more so for doing coding assignments (ask me about those!)
* Reading the news - more of a morbid curiosity these days. Always something interesting (or horrifying) going on.
* Reading wikipedia - history, present things, animals, franchises; its a past-time for me to spend hours reading about things on a whim there.
* Coin collecting - they look cool, foreign coins are a glimpse into foreign cultures too.
* Occasional fiction writing - I have many a draft but hardly a completed work. I have published one thing before but I'm not crazy about it (*dont* ask me about it).
* Occasional non-fictional writing - essays come easily to me, somehow; never really liked them (originally) but life seems to do that some times.
