# Why I Chose To Take an Open Source Course?

From about the age of twelve I was surrounded with open source code, mainly for games. I didn't have much of any ability to code or meaningfully contribute, so the most that took me was downloading and compiling releases. Even in recent years I've had an interest in contributing to open source projects now that I am better equipped, but I've been held back by apprehension regarding the scale of some tasks or the ease of interfacing with online communities. 

I am hoping that this course will allow me to begin contributing to open source coding projects, confidently.
